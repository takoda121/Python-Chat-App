## Compiling 💽
> Tested with pyinstaller  
> Cant assist if its compiled

## Server 👨‍💻
> Soon there will be an official server operated by me  
> The server was tested with php -S   
> Requires "Chat Key" aka the chat is read only without a key  
> Stores: Message, Username (Extracted from Chat Key), Time the message was sent
### Official Server (soon)
> Will have soft anti toxicity  
> Will not require any chatkey  
> Our client (modified, from releases) will be recommended to use (optional)  

### db.json (Server) 💾
> A json file that stores the messages, usernames, and time that the message was sent  
> Not encrypted (yet)
### users.json (Server) 💾
> Stores Chat Key, Name for the chat key user, Role for the chat key user  
> Current roles are user and admin
### Admin role 🚨
> It's not that hard! Just put this character: ㅤ (\u3164) next to their username!   
> Makes their username red   
### Server Settings ⚙️
> If you want Anti-Toxicity than get a Perspective API key.  
## Client 🧮
> Nothing really.
